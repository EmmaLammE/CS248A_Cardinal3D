# Stanford CS248A Assignment 3 (PathTracer)

We have created a [Wiki](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/) that will be the primary source of information about this assignment. On that page you will find all the details about how to use the starter code, what you need to implement, and tips/guidelines for implementing it. This document only contains administrative details about building the starter code, grading, and submission.

## Due Date

The assignment is due Feb. 27 at 11:59 PM.

## Submission Instructions
Please zip the following files and upload your zipped file to Gradescope.

* `Cardinal3D/src` folder
* writeup (.txt, .doc, .pdf)

One team only needs one submission, please tag your teammates in your submission.

## Code Environment

This codebase should compile on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows on a typical environment. Check out the [building Guide](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/build/) to install dependencies and building the code. 

When you have successfully built your code, you should get an executable named `Cardinal3D`. Upon starting the program, it should be in model mode. The [User Guide](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/guide/) details how to use the interface. 

### Starting off with your codebase from PA2

The MeshEdit and PathTracer assignments use the same source code for Cardinal3D. You may do any one of the following to get started on PathTracer:
1. Rebase your MeshEdit to this repository to receive all the new PA3-specific starter code changes.
2. You may make a fresh clone of this repository, and then copy over your PA2 solution from meshedit.cpp to your new local repository.
You do not need MeshEdit to work on PathTracer, but you may appreciate having more Cardinal3D functionality at your disposal.

## Acknowledgement

CS248A course staff would like to thank Professor Keenan Crane and his course assistants for the initial development of assignment materials.
