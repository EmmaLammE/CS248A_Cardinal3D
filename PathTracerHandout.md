# Stanford CS248A Assignment 3 (PathTracer)

We have created a [Wiki](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/) that will be the primary source of information about this assignment. On that page you will find all the details about how to use the starter code, what you need to implement, and tips/guidelines for implementing it. This document only contains administrative details about building the starter code, grading, and submission.

## Due Date

The assignment is due Feb. 27 at 11:59 PM.

## Submission Instructions
Please zip the following files and upload your zipped file to Gradescope.

* XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
* writeup (.txt, .doc, .pdf)

One team only needs one submission, please tag your teammates in your submission.

## Code Environment

This codebase should compile on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows on a typical environment. Check out the [building Guide](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/build/) to install dependencies and building the code. 

When you have successfully built your code, you should get an executable named `Cardinal3D`. Upon starting the program, it should be in model mode. The [User Guide](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/guide/) details how to use the interface. 

## Acknowledgement

CS248A course staff would like to thank Professor Keenan Crane and his course assistants for the initial development of assignment materials.
